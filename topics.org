** Inheritance and the prototype chain
  + Javascript has only Objects. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. Each prototype object has its prototype chain, recursively, until the last prototype is `null`. `null` has no prototype, and is the final link in the prototype chain


** bind
  + bind creates a new function, when invoked has its this keyword set to the argument passed in


** this
  + arrow functions in ES6 are lexically scoped(its value is set to the this value of the enclosing execution context)




** IIFEs (immediately invoked function expressions)
   + module pattern in javascript, return an object instead of a function



** closures & higher order functions


** immutability
